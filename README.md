This README contains information about the run_analysis.R script and associated codebook, CodeBook.md.

run_analysis.R is an R script that manipulates data from the UCI HAR dataset. Run the script from a working directory that contains the UCI HAR Dataset folder. The script produces a tidy dataset that I've exported and saved as tidy_dataset.txt.

The codebook contains an explanation of the formatting of the tidy dataset, descriptions of variables, and links to the original dataset.
